							<p> 
								For this project my team and I focused on investigation the environmental impact of passenger vehicles through looking at each vehicle's total emissions through its entire lifecycle. 
								As policies continue to push for electrification and the adoption of electric vehicles, we found it important to evaluate how impactful these initiatives are to the environment and society.
								Our project aims to translate scientific findings from climate researchers into concepts that are easy to understand by the general public so that they can be better informed about electric vehicles and what sustainable transportation means.
							</p>
							<p>
								During our project, we found that most of the necessary information for accurate lifetime emissions estimates is locked up in academic and government data, leading to a gap between consumer-facing information and the most accurate estimates. 
								Thus, we were in contact with the EPA over the course of the project, as we hoped to make structured EV data more publicly available. 
								To that end we have provided our data and code to the public in the hopes that others can learn from and add on to our results.
							</p>
							<p> <b style="font-size:1.25em">MY ROLE:</b><br>
								In addition to data collection and background research to create our model, my role in this project was focused on creating interactive information visualizations using design principles that can help users to better understand concepts that are introduced in our website. I was also responsible for the front end development of our emissions calculator and developing digestible outputs for the tool.</p>
						
							<p>
								<b style="font-size:1.25em">DELIVERABLES:</b><br>
								Using the data that we obtained both from direct conversations with the EPA and from previously public data, we were able to create an <b>interactive website</b> and a <b>vehicle emissions tool</b>, called Emissions Explorer. 
								We break down how and why EVs still emit, and let people explore how different factors-- charging location, vehicle type, and mileage–- all impact emissions. 
								The Emissions Explorer allows a user to input almost any vehicle (gas, hybrid, or electric) and outputs the lifetime emissions of that vehicle, along with useful context about how that vehicle compares to its peers. 
								We built our emissions model calculations using data from the GREET model, created by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), and vehicle emissions and weight data from the EPA. Emissions Explorer models the production, use, and end-of-life emissions for a vehicle, and is the first tool to integrate these calculations into a digestible, consumer-facing product. 
								In addition to material inputs and outputs that our tool focuses on, we also look at societal factors that may affect EV adoption in our informational website.
