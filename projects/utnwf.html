							<p> 
								We partnered with IBM and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) to develop an open water data platform that helps stakeholders in the Upper Tana River Basin better understand and manage water resources. 
								We built upon work done by TNC to create a platform that will be easy for government officials and water managers to access and use, allowing local stakeholders to make informed water management decisions. 
								We gathered and analyzed publicly available water quality data and socioeconomic characteristics to explore relationships between environmental and social factors that may affect water availability in the area. 
								The final deliverables of our project offer a simple and effective user experience and will shed much-needed light on the increasing issues of water scarcity and degraded quality in a changing climate.	
								<br><br>
								<b>Goals:</b><br>
								&emsp;&emsp;• Understand changing water resource conditions in the Upper Tana Basin<br>
								&emsp;&emsp;• Provide insight on the efficacy of TNC interventions as the Water Fund transitions to independent management<br>
								&emsp;&emsp;• Collect and analyze data relevant to evaluating water quality and quantity<br>

							<p> <b style="font-size:1.25em">KEY FINDINGS:</b><br>
								<b>1. Land Cover Change</b> 
								<br>
								Land cover data from the MODIS, Sentinel, and Copernicus datasets was obtained for various years in the period between 2000-2019.
								<b>Land cover</b> does not change drastically over the time period from 2001 to 2019. Forest and cropland cover about the same amount of area. 		 	
								<b>Soil moisture</b> was investigated to provide insight on how land cover affects land surface parameters and water availability and quality in general for the region.
								For all of the depths analyzed (0 to 10 cm, 10 to 40 cm, and 40 to 100 cm), areas with more forest cover have a higher soil moisture content. Additionally, soil moisture seems to moderately increase at greater depths.
								Comparing land cover with surface runoff can also provide insight on erosion and water quality in the region. 
								When looking at the general trend of surface runoff over time, <b>surface runoff</b> seems to be increasing, indicating there may be an increase in erosion leading to worsening water quality. 
								However, variation in the amount of runoff each month also seems to have increased, which could be related to factors other than land cover change, such as the increased variability in precipitation.

								</center>
								<br><br>
								<b>2. Effects of Climate Variability</b> 
								<br>
								Kenya has two wet seasons called the long rains (March - May) and short rains (October - December). 
								The measurements of precipitation remain relatively constant in similar seasons for the 1980-1985 period. 
								For the 2015-2019 period, while the dry and rainy seasons did not necessarily shift from the 1980-1985 period, 
								the <b>magnitude of rain events during the wet seasons have likely increased</b>, which may be attributed to global climate change. 
								This is hypothesized to not affect the amount of rainfall but rather increase the severity of storms in shorter periods of times. 
								<b>There is a significant difference in precipitation levels</b> for the five-year periods of 1980-1984 and 2015-2019. 
								<br>
								Exploring the correlation between precipitation and soil moisture in the Upper Tana River Basin can provide insight on how changes in precipitation from climate variability may affect soil moisture and in turn agricultural production. 
								Greater amounts of precipitation will increase soil moisture, but effects of precipitation will vary depending on temperature.

								</center>
								<br>
								<b>3. Efficacy of TNC Water Management Interventions</b> 
								<br>
								Two micro watersheds without interventions (Karuruumo and Thika Valley) and two watersheds with interventions (Githambara and Mbogiti) were studied in depth.
								Micro watersheds with implemented interventions showed <b>improvements in water quantity</b> (water level) and <b>quality</b> (total suspended solids and turbidity) compared to the control watersheds, 
								and the interventions seem to be effective in improving water resource conditions. 
								However, further analysis is needed to fully attribute these improvements to the interventions. 
								Collecting data more regularly along with having on-the-ground verification of satellite data would strengthen the analysis of interventions and water conditions in the Basin. 
								While no large changes in land cover were observed, precipitation has changed significantly in the past decades, confirming anecdotal concerns about the effects of a changing climate on agriculture. 
								Sustainable adaptations can help stakeholders in this region weather changes in conditions.
